# Back Packer

## What is the Back Packer project?
The Back Packer project is my first project working with genetic algorithms. For this, I tackle a classical problem: you have a backpack of limited volume and several objects of certain values that you want to bring with you on your trip. What objects should you chose in order to maximize the total value of the bag?

The code is written in C++ and you can already download it to try it.

But what is interesting is to plot the data of the evolution of the bag's content along the generations.

## TODO

I'm currently working on a html + Javascript page that will allow you to visualize the results.
